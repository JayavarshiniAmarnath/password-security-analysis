A hands-on cybersecurity internship project focused on evaluating password complexity and strength. This repository includes multiple password samples, strength test results, analysis of common password attacks, and best practices for creating secure passwords.
# Password Strength and Complexity Evaluation

## Description
This project explores how password complexity affects cybersecurity. It includes creating sample passwords, testing their strength using online tools, and summarizing best practices and attack vectors.

## Key Topics
- Password creation
- Password strength testing
- Common password attacks
- Best practices for strong passwords

## Tools Used
- https://howsecureismypassword.net
- https://www.passwordmonster.com

## Learnings
- Complex passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- Length and randomness matter more than clever substitutions.
- Password managers and 2FA enhance overall security.
